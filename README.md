If you know what you are doing, this could be handy for your research.

Of course you are gonna need Autodock Vina sources on your computer and you need to handle with all of directory mess that i created. Don't worry it's not that bad.

First of all just prep your ligands with extract.py and than run dock_beta.py with output files, this should handle with your all docking needs. My ultimate goal is automisation of the all processes but I couldn't find time for it, yet. Don't forget to handle resources on all scripts, you should configure it to your specific hardware to maximise the performance. Basically this is my first target, so DO IT!

THIS IS NOT A STABLE PROJECT, USE IT ON YOUR OWN RISK.
